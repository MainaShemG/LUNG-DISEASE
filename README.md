# Lung Disease Classifier

This project is a lung disease classifier between COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal lungs using X-Ray images. It was developed as part of my 4th year project.

## Motivation

This project was motivated by my experience during my external attachment period at the Kenyatta National Hospital, where I saw the challenges faced by both patients and hospital staff when trying to diagnose and treat lung diseases. I wanted to develop a tool that would be able to accurately and quickly classify different types of lung diseases, in order to help both patients and healthcare workers.

## Technology Stack

The classifier was developed using convolutional neural networks (CNN). Additional images such as trees, cars, furniture, and buildings were also added to the dataset to differentiate the X-Ray images from other images.

## Goal

The goal of this project was to develop an accurate classifier for differentiating between COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal lungs.

## Results

The model was able to achieve an accuracy of 87% on the test set. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying the different lung conditions.

## Conclusion

This project has successfully developed a lung disease classifier between COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal lungs using X-Ray images and convolutional neural networks. The model achieved an accuracy of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in classifying different lung conditions.
